# MMMRS
First use of linear-regression model to find songs that mash-up well with each other

## YOU MUST UNZIP THE DATA.ZIP IN A FILE CALLED "data"

MANUAL MUSIC MASHUP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Project Description:
This program uses linear regression models to find the best songs to mashup with a selected song based on previously inputted data. Users can make their own preferences
between two songs they like or dislike together, which the model will use to give other pairs of songs you may like.

To run locally, open app.py and run it, entering 2 afterwards. This will then give you a link to a website where you can enter in songs.

Things to import:
- CSV
- Pandas
- Scikit Learn
- Flask
- Matplotlib
All latest as of August 6, 2024

If you want to reset the model/data, delete the data.txt file.

Things to update in the future:
- Download and upload separate user data preferences for better usage
- More pages (about me, training model vs. getting good songs, etc.)
- Host application on Google Cloud or Pythonanywhere
